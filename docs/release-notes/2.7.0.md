## Breaking Changes

- Library `ranger-plugins-audit` is not available starting with Apache Ranger `2.7.0` release. Contents of this library are split into multiple libraries, one for each audit destination. This enables plugin implementations to minimize dependencies by including libraries only for the destinations they need. Plugin implementations should replace references to ranger-plugins-audit with audit destination specific library's listed below:
    - ranger-audit-dest-cloudwatch 
    - ranger-audit-dest-es 
    - ranger-audit-dest-hdfs 
    - ranger-audit-dest-kafka
    - ranger-audit-dest-log4j 
    - ranger-audit-dest-solr 
- Authorization plugin packages in Apache Ranger `2.7.0` include dependent libraries for two audit destinations only â€“ `Solr` and `HDFS`. In earlier versions of Apache Ranger, plugin packages included libraries for all available audit destinations, like `AWS CloudWatch`, `Elasticsearch`, `Kafka`, `Log4j`. If support for other audit destinations is needed, it will be necessary to rebuild the plugin package after updating pom and packaging files of the plugin.
